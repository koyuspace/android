koyu.space is a community based on the Mastodon network. This app is the entry into the fediverse to communicate with the people you like. koyu.space uses Mastodon and it has some advantages. Instead on relying on a centralized infrastructure, Mastodon relies on a decentralized infrastructure. That's pretty much like E-Mail: You have an e-mail address, but you can also interact with people on other servers. Besides that we have some other features included, that aren't available on Mastodon.
